# Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset
to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover
trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal
factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and click the [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd) to get redirected to the kaggle page to download the dataset.

# Steps involved

The EDA consists of the following key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather the terrorism dataset from a reliable source.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, handle missing values, and format data types.

3. Data Exploration: Summarize the dataset, visualize data distributions, and calculate basic statistics.

4. Geographic Analysis: Plot geographical distribution of terrorist incidents.

5. Temporal Analysis: Analyze the frequency of terrorist incidents over time.

6. Categorical Analysis: Explore categorical variables like attack types and target types.

7. Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations between variables.

8. Factors Analysis: Analyze factors contributing to terrorist activities.

9. Data Storytelling: Summarize findings and insights using visualizations.

# Results
In the end we will find the insights of terrorist datasets such as attack types,high risk regions and number of attacks over time.
